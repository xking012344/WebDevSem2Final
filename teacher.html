    <h1>About the teacher</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Meredith Bryant and I'm the teacher of the Entrepreneurship program here at Walker Career Center.
        Before I came to Warren Central I worked in the marketing industry for 8 years with top named clients like The
        Children's Museum of Indianapolis, The Indianapolis Zoo, Former Colts player Andrew Luck etc., and then the
        Pandemic hit! I felt like I hit my peak with the job I was currently at so I decided to go back to school and
        obtain my teacher's license. Those who can't anymore, teach! Since being with the Walker Career Center I have
        had the opportunity to teach several different business courses at all grade levels; most being dual credit
        where the students will receive college credit for each course they complete. This is the first year that
        Entrepreneurship has been offered as a pathway and the students have taken full advantage of it. I have learned
        so much about the Eastside and the community that surrounds us doing this program, and I couldn't imagine being
        anywhere else!
